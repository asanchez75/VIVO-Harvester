NOTE: This example has not yet been migrated to use the VIVO ISF ontology.  It is just a copy of the 1.0-1.5-examples version

You need to modify certains files to ingest data using this example.

Here are the files that need to be modified:

1. vivo.model.xml

check that the database information is configured correctly for your system.  By default, it will
connect to a database called vitrodb_test on localhost

2. run-mods.sh

set to the directory where the harvester was installed
HARVESTER_INSTALL_DIR
(Note: there may be other shell scripts which have a set HARVESTER_INSTALL_DIR which
will need to modified)

3. raw.recordhanlder.xml

change the fileDir as necessary.  It defaults to ./input and is where the bibutils input file
should be stored.

5. all the changenamespace-*.config.xml files

change the "newNamespace" value to the namespace of your VIVO instance
