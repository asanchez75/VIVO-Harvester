    <!-- 
    wordiness - How much should be displayed on the console when the sanitize is run.  Options range from nothing at all to errors only to general
    information to more detailed debugging information.
    -
    Allowable values:
    OFF - No log information is displayed on the console.
    ERROR - All error messages are displayed. 
    WARN - Error and warning messages are displayed.
    INFO - Errors, warnings, and general user information is displayed.  This is the default.
    DEBUG - Errors, warnings, general information, and information intended for debuggers is displayed to the console.
    TRACE - All of the above as well as even finer-grain debugging information is displayed.
    ALL - Everything that goes into the log is displayed on the console.

    Values meaningful for SanitizeMODSXML:
    ERROR - All runtime errors
    INFO - Number of records sanitized, number of records which did not need sanitization
    DEBUG - Removal of xmlns element, note if there was an error parsing a dateIssued value when normalizing dates
    TRACE - Start of sanitize of an individual record, note if no sanitize run is needed on an individual record
     -->
	<Param name="wordiness">INFO</Param>

    <!-- 
    input - relative path to the configuration file for the record handler from which the input will be pulled.
     -->
	<Param name="input">post-bibutils.recordhandler.xml</Param>

    <!-- 
    output - relative path to the configuration file of the record handler in which the results of the sanitization will be placed,
             so that other Harvester tools or other programs may operate on the data.
     -->
	<Param name="output">post-sanitize.recordhandler.xml</Param>

    <!-- 
    force - determines whether we want the system to decide if a record needs sanitization (based on a checksum of the most recent record of
            the same name that was sanitized) and to skip those which do not need to be sanitized, for the sake of performance
    -
    Possible Values:
    true - Force, meaning always sanitize all records
    false - Decide if the record needs sanitization before sanitizing it

    <Param name="force">true</Param>
